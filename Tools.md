Unvanquished has a number of tools to assist developers and artists in
creating content. All required editors and tools are expected to be free
software. If you notice a specific task can't be done with free
software, [please report the issue
there](https://github.com/Unvanquished/unvanquished-infrastructure/issues).

## Common editors

### Specific editors we have created, or we maintain, or we may contribute to

See for an easy way to build all of them on Linux.

- is a graphical level editor,
  maintained by [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org) from id Software,
  Xonotic, and Unvanquished code;

- is a graphical application to assist mappers in replacing textures in
  game levels,
  created for Unvanquished.

### Other generic editors

Unvanquished does not provide any way to install them, it is recommended
to get them from their respective projects.

- is a 3D modeler used for modeling and animating Unvanquished models,
  by Blender Foundation;

- is a graphical editor used to edit Unvanquished textures and other
  images,
  by GIMP Development Team;

- is a vector-based image editor to editor Unvanquished scalable
  images,
  by Inkscape authors;

- is an audio editor,
  by Audacity Team.

## Common tools

### Specific tools we have created, or we maintain, or we may contribute to

See for an easy way to build all of them on Linux.

- is a command-line tool to generates shader files from directories of
  texture maps,
  created for Unvanquished;

- is a command-line tool to compile game levels,
  maintained by [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org) from id Software,
  Xonotic, and Unvanquished code;

- is a command-line tool to compress images optimized for GPUs,
  maintained by Unvanquished from BinomialLLC, Unity Technologies and
  Unvanquished code;

- is a command-line tool to compile IQM models,
  maintained by [FTE QuakeWorld](https://fte.triptohell.info) from Lee
  Salzman ([Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org)) and FTE QuakeWorld
  code;

- is a command-line tool to build and package asset repositories,
  created for Unvanquished.

### Other generic tools

See for an easy way to build all of them on Linux, but it is very likely
you'll find upstream packages for your system.

- [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp) is a WebP
  image converter,
  by Google;
- [opusenc](https://opus-codec.org/) is an Opus audio converter,
  by IETF, Xiph.Org and Skype;

  by Xiph.Org;
- [flac](https://xiph.org/flac/) is a FLAC audio converter,
  by Xiph.Org.

## Obsolete tools

- was a navmesh generator,
  maintained by Unvanquished from id Software code and Unvanquished
  code, starting with Unvanquished 0.54.0 the navmesh generator is built
  in the game itself so there is no need anymore to use an external
  tool.

## Stalled editors

- was a project for a web-based utility to rearrange UV islands in a
  model either to minimize texture sheet usage or to make room for new
  geometry.
