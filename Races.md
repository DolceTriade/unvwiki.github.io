Unvanquished features two races:

- [Aliens](Aliens "wikilink")
- [Humans](Humans "wikilink")

For decades some players and developers are dreaming of implementing a
third race. The Unvanquished name and domain name were even given by a
Tremulous mod named Unvanquished that was purposed to implement a third
race. Success at implementing a third race is still to be seen.
