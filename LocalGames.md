It is highly recommended you play online against bots, even if no one
else is around, so that other players can turn up and join you.
Sometimes this is not an option:

- Bad internet connection
- Wanting to try out things in an environment with absolute control
  (cheats)
- Wanting to play a game over LAN with friends.

If you want to play a game offline you can start and join your own
server. Select "Create Server" at the bottom of the game listings
screen, accessed from the main menu.

# Bots

Even though bots are completely implemented in the game, there is no GUI
to set them up. You need to enter commands at the console once in a
game, accessible by pressing the Tilde key (~) on your keyboard.

Type in **\bot** and hit enter to get started. The documentation for the
command will open.

`Examples:`
`\bot add Bacon humans`
`\bot add Steak humans`
`\bot add Cabbage aliens`
`\bot add Garlic aliens`
