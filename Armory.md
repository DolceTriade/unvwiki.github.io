Allows for humans to purchase and sell equipment. Ammunition can be
refilled for free, as well.

## Tips

- Multiple humans can use a single armory at the same time, so there's
  usually no need for more than one in the main encampment and one in
  each forward base.

## Menus for weapons and Armors

There is 2 entry menu in the Armory. By default, it's the one for
weapons, but if you want buy armor, you need select the second entry :

## Will end soon

Armory is crucial building. Without one, you can't reload weapons, or
swap to the CT (Construction Tool) to build or repair buildings. In case
there is no armory and no Telenode, the Human time is done.
