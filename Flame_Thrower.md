Shoots a continuous stream of fire.

## Tip

- Set alien buildings on fire with it. This is especially useful where
  they are tightly packed.

<!-- -->

- Be careful not to burn yourself or your team mates with it.

<!-- -->

- Don't use this to defend your base. You may kill the alien, but you'll
  damage your own structures as well.

<!-- -->

- You can put flames on ground, makes for a good way to hurt aliens
  chasing you (and to make you know about it!)
