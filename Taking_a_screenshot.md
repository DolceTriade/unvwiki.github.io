For any usages like showcasing the game or reporting a graphical issue,
you may want to take a screenshot of the game.

By default, the F11 key takes lossy JPEG screenshot of the running game,
and the Shift + F11 key combination takes lossless PNG screenshot of the
game.

The screenshots are stored in a `screenshot` subfolder of the user
directory, which differs according to your operating system:

There is a limit to this, the screenshot key may not work in user
interfaces like the console, the main menu or the circle menus (build,
buy and evolve menus for example). You may then rely on your Operating
System way to screenshot an application, for example using the PrtScrn
(Print Screen) key. The behaviour may differ given your system and
environment.
