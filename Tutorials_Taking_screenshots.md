The Daemon engine can take screenshots in TGA, PNG, or JPEG format. The
commands for which are `\screenshot`, `\screenshotPNG`, and
`\screenshotJPEG`, respectively.

Screenshots are saved to the `screenshots` folder in the [data
location](Game_locations "wikilink") for your system.

You may want to selectively disable drawing certain elements when taking
screenshots:

- To hide the first-person weapon, set `cg_drawGun` to `0`.
- To hide everything on the HUD, set `cg_draw2D` to `0`.
