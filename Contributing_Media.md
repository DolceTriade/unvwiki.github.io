This page outlines information about the project as a whole so that you
can get involved more quickly.

## Before you begin

Before following these guidelines, please read the [main article on
contributing](Contributing "wikilink"). It contains useful information
about how the project is structured as a whole and what our philosophies
are towards development.

## Trying Out the Game

Basic download instructions are available from [our
homepage](http://www.unvanquished.net/download). If you use an
unsupported operating system, please read the instructions on
[acquiring](Getting_the_source "wikilink") and
[compiling](Compiling_the_source "wikilink") the source code.

Although there currently are very few players on servers at any point in
time, you still have a couple of options to play the game to try it out:

- **Play against bots.** — There are currently a number of servers with
  enough bots that the game is playable even without any human
  opponents. The training server typically always has bots, and even has
  a few special game modes. Alternatively you can use console commands
  to [add them to your own local games](LocalGames "wikilink")
- **Wait for a scheduled development game.** — For the past several
  weeks, we have been scheduling games on the weekends to ensure an
  adequate number of players for testing. You can get information about
  scheduled games on the [chat](chat "wikilink").
- **Test offline.** — You can always start a [testing
  session](Testing#Starting_a_testing_session "wikilink") and [use some
  cheats](Testing#Testing_with_gameplay_code "wikilink") to test all the
  different weapons and character classes.

Of course, you can always check who's playing online at any given moment
via the [master server status
page](https://www.unvanquished.net/?page_id=340).

## Licensing

### Recommended licenses

Please understand that you will be expected to license your work. You
are also expected to have some basic understanding of copyright law.
**It is extremely important that you license your work correctly and
that you understand the implications of what you are doing!** Also note
that assets that are of questionable origin will not be included in the
game. Note that the default contribution license is CC BY SA 3.0 (see
below), unless you specify another license from one listed below, by
contributing to Unvanquished you are placing your work under CC By SA
3.0 licence. You must have right to.

You are expected to use one of the CC By SA 3.0 compatible licenses:

| Name                                                 |              | Features              |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Full                                                 | Abbreviated  | Requires attribution? |
| Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported | CC BY-SA 3.0 | Yes                   |
| Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported            | CC BY 3.0    | Yes                   |
| Creative Commons Zero (Public Domain Dedication) 1.0 | CC0 1.0      | No                    |

All of these licenses allow redistributing your work, to be maintained
by Unvanquished contributor, and mixed in Unvanquished work. Please note
that we would much prefer if you would use one of those licenses. Not
using one of those licenses in certain situations might prevent your
work from being included.

If you disagree with all of the above licenses, please contact any of
the project leads with your concerns. If you have another license in
mind, please inform us. Be prepared to defend your criticisms of the
Creative Commons licenses (i.e., provide a compelling argument) and your
choice for another license. Be aware that more restrictive licenses are
not likely to be accepted by the project heads.

### Licenses to avoid

Some assets used some problematic licenses which are discouraged since
they prevents the game to be distributed or referenced by some
platforms. They also prevent some work to be done. For example rendering
lightmaps using “lightfilter” or “alphashadow” techniques is a derivated
work and may requires asset license compatibility according to how you
interpret this to be original or how your local legislation is written.
Creating a machinima is creating a derivated work from all assets
visible and heard and therefore require license compatibility. Those
problematic licenses are CC By SA 3.0 incompatibles and mixing assets
covered by incompatible licenses is a copyright infringement and
therefore illegal, for that reason these problematic licenses must be
avoided in game core assets (the ones that makes you unable to play if
they are missing) and must not be used for newer contributions:

| Name                                                               |                 | Features              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Full                                                               | Abbreviated     | Requires attribution? |
| Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 | Yes                   |
| Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported                 | CC BY-ND 3.0    | Yes                   |
| Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported   | CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 | Yes                   |
|                                                                    |                 |                       |

### Marking your Work

If you are working in Blender, please add a license to your work visible
in the default screen layout visible in a text editor view. **Please
note that you should not do this if you are not the original creator of
the work.** For example, if you are animating a model that was created
by someone else, ask **them** to add a notice themselves.

You are advised to use the following template:

`Copyright `` `<var>`your real name`</var>`.`

`This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.`
[`http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/`](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)

Of course, you should modify this template to match whichever license
your are using.

### Mappers

In creating a map, you likely will end up using textures from a variety
of sources. You **must** include copies of licenses and notices of
attribution for any and all textures that you use not created by
yourself. Those textures which you have created yourself should be
licensed as outlined above, and a notice included. It is recommended to
include a file named <var>`mapname`</var>`.txt`,
`map-`<var>`mapname`</var>`.txt` or
`map-`<var>`mapname`</var>`-`<var>`version`</var>`.txt` inside a
directory named `about` in your
[`.dpk`](Packaging_game_data "wikilink").

## Introducing Yourself

Once you have access to the developer subforums, please create a post on
the [Assets &
Artwork](http://unvanquished.net/forum/forumdisplay.php/36-Assets-amp-Artwork)
subforum telling us a little about yourself.

At the end of your introduction, please add the following information
using this template:

`[LIST]`
`[*] [B]Skillset[/B]: `<var>`List your skills here`</var>
`[*] [B]Software[/B]: `<var>`List software you know well here`</var>
`[*] [B]E-mail[/B]: `<var>`Please place an e-mail address that you would like to be contacted at here`</var>
`[*] [B]Preferred means of contact[/B]: `<var>`How would you like to be contacted?`</var>
`[*] [B]Primary operating system[/B]: `<var>`Which operating system (and version) do you use the most often? (E.g., Mac OS X 10.6)`</var>
`[*] [B]Portfolio[/B]: `<var>`Add links to any work that you have done that is visible on the internet`</var>
`[/LIST]`

If you do not have a portfolio and you are a 2d or 3d artist, please
upload a gallery of images of your work to imgur or other reliable image
sharing site. Similarly, if you are an audio engineer or musician,
upload your work to some audio sharing site.

You may wish to include other information, such as:

- Alternate means of contact (e.g., Skype);
- Your time zone, so that we know when we can contact you.

Continue reading for more specific instructions.

## Animators

In addition to the [above
information](#Introducing_Yourself "wikilink"), we'd like to know the
following about you:

- What software do you use?
- How familiar are you with your preferred software? I.e., what features
  of your animation package do you utilize? For example, if you use
  Blender, do you know how to use actions and constraints?

We currently use the format for animations. Please familiarize yourself
with the following documentation before beginning to animate anything:

- Read the [workflow overview](Modeling#Workflow_overview "wikilink").
  This explains the workflow shared by our artists for bringing a
  concept into reality. You are expected to understand this. If you have
  any questions, do not hesitate to ask.
- From the model exporting guide, please read the
  [overview](Exporting_Models#Overview "wikilink") and the [What is
  MD5?](Exporting_Models#What_is_MD5.3F "wikilink") section. You will
  need to understand these in order to be able to create an animation
  that can successfully be exported from your animation package of
  choice and loaded into the game.

In particular, you are expected to know the limitations of the format.
**If you do not respect these limitations, you are guaranteed to have a
great deal if difficulty when attempting to export your model.** While
the art lead is more than willing to provide help to get your asset
in-game, you would be wasting his/her time by not reading the
documentation beforehand; it is only respectful to do so.

## Audio Engineers & Musicians

In addition to the [above
information](#Introducing_Yourself "wikilink"), we'd like to know the
following about you:

- What hardware and instruments do you have access to?
- If you are a musician, what instruments do you play? If you don't play
  an instrument, what do you compose music with?
- If you are a musician, what sort of music do you like to compose?
- If you are an audio engineer, what is your particular skillset?

You are expected to familiarize yourself with the following:

- Please read the [documentation](Music_and_sounds "wikilink") on music
  and sounds. Be aware that at the time of writing (19 March 2013), this
  information is rather inadequate, but it will at least answer some
  questions.
- Please take a look at the [sound progress](Sound_Progress "wikilink")
  page for an idea of what sounds there are that need replacement.

In addition, you should be aware that many sounds present in
Unvanquished are inherited from Tremulous and **must** be replaced.
**Note that this is non-negotiable**: the sounds from Tremulous failed
to prove having trustable sources and we prefer to replace them entirely
to not take any risk of copyright infrigement accusation even if no one
never claimed that since Tremulous was released in 2006.

## Concept Artists

In addition to the [above
information](#Introducing_Yourself "wikilink"), we'd like to know the
following about you:

- What is your preferred medium? E.g., do you draw with a tablet in
  Photoshop, or do you use pencil and paper? Be specific.
- What is your greatest strength with respect to drawing? I.e., what is
  the one thing that you think you are the best at drawing?
- How long do you expect it to take to create a concept? We're not
  [clients from hell](http://clientsfromhell.net/), so we're not going
  to pressure you to do things quickly, but we'd just like to know in
  advance if it might take a week or whatever so that know you haven't
  just died on us if we don't hear from you for a while!

Please be aware:

- If you are unsure of what you would like to work on, please
  familiarize yourself with both the [alien](Aliens "wikilink") and
  [human](Humans "wikilink") teams.
- Be aware that you are expected to [try the
  game](#Trying_Out_the_Game "wikilink") at some point!
- If you would like to know what character and weapon models have not
  been completed that are therefore available to create a concept for,
  take a look at the [modeling progress](modeling_progress "wikilink")
  page. Anything that is not being worked on is fair game, even if other
  concepts have been made before.
- There is not currently a listing of all the concepts made for the
  game, so you will have to browse the [Assets & Artwork
  subforum](http://unvanquished.net/forum/forumdisplay.php/36-Assets-amp-Artwork)
  for now.

## Mappers

In addition to the [above
information](#Introducing_Yourself "wikilink"), we'd like to know the
following about you:

- What maps have you released to the public in the past, and for what
  games?
- What experience do you have with mapping software? Include any and all
  software that you have used, even if it was not for a Quake-derived
  game, and some indication of your skill with that software.

You are expected to familiarize yourself with the following:

- Please read the [mapping guide](Mapping "wikilink") all the way
  through. You do not necessarily need to know how to use every feature
  of the tools right away, but you should understand the basics.
- [How to get data in the game](Packaging_game_data "wikilink"). This is
  less important when you begin mapping, but you must understand this
  when you approach time to release or upload your map online for
  testing. Ideally, you would not be creating a final release of your
  map without at least one beta test version.

## Modelers

In addition to the [above
information](#Introducing_Yourself "wikilink"), we'd like to know the
following about you:

- What software do you **prefer** to use?
- What is your personal workflow? Do you begin with a high poly model
  and retopo that? Or do you begin and end with the geometry that will
  end up in the final game?
- Are you capable of completing a modeling assignment, or will you need
  assistance? If you will need assistance (e.g., with retopoing,
  unwrapping, texturing, rigging, or animation), please inform us. Be
  specific.
- Are you familiar with modern techniques? Specifically, we'd like to
  know if you know what the following are and how to use them:
  - Normal maps;
  - Bump maps;
  - Specular maps;
  - Physical maps (PBR);
  - Glow maps;
  - Height maps;
  - Smoothing groups;
- Are you familiar with the idea of not storing lighting information in
  your diffuse texture? **If you do not understand what this means,
  please ask.** A guide will eventually be written on this.
- Is hardware an issue? E.g., if you are going to be editing a very high
  poly model, do you have a video card that can handle that?

You are expected to familiarize yourself with the following:

- Read the [workflow overview](Modeling#Workflow_overview "wikilink").
  This explains the workflow shared by our artists for bringing a
  concept into reality. You are expected to understand this. If you have
  any questions, do not hesitate to ask.
- From the model exporting guide, please read the
  [overview](Exporting_Models#Overview "wikilink"). If you are not going
  to animate your model yourself, this is less important, but it is good
  to know anyway.

## Texture Artists

In addition to the [above
information](#Introducing_Yourself "wikilink"), we'd like to know the
following about you:

- Are you familiar with the idea of not storing lighting information in
  your diffuse texture? **If you do not understand what this means,
  please ask.** A guide will eventually be written on this.

You are expected to familiarize yourself with the following:

- Please read the [texture creation](texture_creation "wikilink") guide.
  This contains important information about what formats the engine
  supports and where you can obtain special tools that you may need to
  create content specifically for our engine.

## Screenshot and movie

Before take screenshot or make a movie, please set high preset graphic,
or better.

You may want to disable all 2D draw (name, minimap, ping...) by command
(change the **0** by **1** to enable again).

Then if you use SHIFT with the screenshot hotkey (F11 by default), the
screenshot will be done with PNG format.

#### For movies

With Linux, you can try
[SimpleScreenRecorder](https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/).

Or maybe
