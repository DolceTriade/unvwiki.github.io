Drills the ground for materials.

## Tips

- Spread them apart for maximum mining efficiency. Keep in mind that two
  drills right next to each other will mine out less material than a
  single drill.

<!-- -->

- Defend your drills well. If a drill is destroyed, you'll lose a
  portion of your stored material.

<!-- -->

- If you feel a forward base with a drill in it isn't going to last for
  much longer, deconstruct the buildables that are worth money to
  prevent the loss of material.

When Drills and [Leeches](Leech "wikilink") are close together, they
annihilates themself.

1.  Only with the [Construction Kit](Construction_Kit "wikilink") you
    can see that they consume BP instead generate power.

It's the same for a Drill near a [Leech](Leech "wikilink").
