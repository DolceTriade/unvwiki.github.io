## Get started easy

You're in a rush? Follow [few steps to be ready to
play](Get_started_easy "wikilink").

## Getting the game

Most users will want to download the launcher from the [download
page](https://unvanquished.net/download) on our website.

Using the universal zip instead may require for you to have specific
knowledge about your operating system to get the game running. Prefer
the launcher if possible.

Alternatively you can download the universal zip on:

- [GitHub release
  page](https://github.com/Unvanquished/Unvanquished/releases),
- [SourceForge.net file
  browser](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unvanquished/files/Universal_Zip),
- [IndieDB download
  page](https://www.indiedb.com/games/unvanquished/downloads).

See [Coding](Coding "wikilink") for tips and guides on compiling.
