The first true alien assault form, marauders are agile and can easily
leap over human defenses to strike at critical structures. They possess
the ability to wall-jump, allowing both an easy way to dodge humans and
a way to reach places that only wall-walking forms can get to. It also
allows the marauder to build up speed. The advanced form provides
increased health and a chain lightning attack, which is very effective
against groups of humans and tightly packed human structures.

## Tips

- Marauders move faster while jumping than while walking. Jump
  constantly and lop their heads off!

<!-- -->

- You can easily accelerate down the corridors using the wall jump.

## Advanced Movement

Contrary to the common sense, the Marauder can accelerate in air while
doing slow turns. This technique is called
[strafe-jumping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafe-jumping). All
aliens and humans are capable of strafe-jumping, but the marauder gains
the most from it. Simply hold the forward key together with a left or
right key, and slowly turn in that direction while jumping continuously.
If you turn at the right speed, you will accelerate quickly. You might
want to alternate turning directions to stay on a straight path. Using
this technique you can close the distance or run away much faster than
it's possible with just the normal jumping.

## Background

Originally an arboreal species, the alien that was to become the
marauder evolved on a world with abundant tree cover and rocky
protrusions. With its ability to quickly jump off vertical surfaces, the
marauder could rapidly accelerate itself upwards, to catch new prey or
escape a potential predator. In addition, despite its small size, it is
anything but fragile: a life in the trees and cliffs has provided the
diminutive marauder with exceptional stamina and vigor.

Seizing its potential as a rapid assault unit, the hivemind has modified
the marauderâ€™s talons, turning them from mere climbing implements to
lengthy chitinous blades ending in a single molecule at the edge. With
these, the marauder is capable of slicing through the thickest human
armor with ease, digging through to the vulnerable humans within after a
few quick strikes. The advanced form of the marauder, produced by the
hivemind for more dug-in defenders, is capable of generating massive
amounts of static electricity, stored within specialized glands around
the forelimbs. As the marauder leaps about, electricity is generated,
which may then be released in powerful bursts.

With its capabilities, the marauder is often used as a lone wolf, able
to both fend for itself and rapidly escape before it can be slain. It
can quickly tear apart lone humans, who often find it difficult to
target the rapidly jumping marauder. In addition, the advanced form is
of great use when besieging a well-defended human base, with the
electroshock rapidly destroying large swathes of human equipment.
