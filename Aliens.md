## Description

Composed of a variety of monstrous lifeforms, the alien team places
emphasis on high mobility and brutal short-range attacks. Unlike the
[human](Humans "wikilink") team, the aliens do not use technology, but
rather their own physical capabilities. As such, they possess a
strikingly organic appearance. In addition, the aliens are not bound to
their base to the same extent as the human team, and can function
independently of it, due to their ability to regenerate and the lack of
an ammunition requirement. It is advisable for alien players to make
good usage of cover and stealth, considering the lack of long-range
capability.

Individual aliens evolve into more powerful species, rather than
purchasing more powerful equipment as [Humans](Humans "wikilink") do.

## Tips

- Attack the human's heads to deal the most damage.
- You can not devolve into lesser forms (wrong in 0.52: will be able to
  devolve near overmind).
- aliens can sense their enemies from a short range.
- aliens do not take damages when falling.
- can't evolve when too close to an enemy (wrong in 0.52: only being
  seen prevent evolution)
- aliens which can pounce ([Mantis](Mantis "wikilink"),
  [Dragoon](Dragoon "wikilink")) can jump when landing to bounce,
  reusing their inertia to continue to move fast.
- do not stay close human "dead" buildings: their explosion will hurt
  you

## Forms

Speed is in game's units, and aliens have the same speed whatever the
direction they are going to.

## Buildings

- Alien bases are hard to build, due to their lack of ranged defense.
  All buildings must be both close enough to humans to be effective,
  while still being hidden enough to not be destroyed from afar. Doors
  are usually good for protecting alien structures, because humans then
  MUST go close enough the structure to open the door. Be wary that some
  doors are really large or have shapes that allows a human to jump over
  a barricade put in front of it.

<!-- -->

- Avoid building on floor: building on the floor are vulnerable to pain
  saws, are at flame thrower and shotgun range and are very vulnerable
  to grenades.

<!-- -->

- Fire will spread. Don't build building tightly packed together if you
  don't want a human equipped with a flamer to be able to wipe
  everything in seconds.

<!-- -->

- Trapper's projectile is slow, if it is too far from enemy's passage,
  even a walking, non-suspecting human will "dodge" it without even
  noticing there's a trapper.

<!-- -->

- One of alien's strengths in base building is that their outposts only
  require a single egg. No defenses, sure, but those can be spread
  everywhere.

<!-- -->

- Every alien structures generate "[creep](creep "wikilink")", which
  have various effects, including faster healing.

## Example

The following screenshot shows all types of alien buildable constructs,
with the exception of the [Overmind](Overmind "wikilink"), the
[Booster](Booster "wikilink") and the [Spiker](Spiker "wikilink").

<figure>
<img src="2021-11-Baricaded_door.png" title="2021-11-Baricaded_door.png"
width="1000" />
<figcaption>2021-11-Baricaded_door.png</figcaption>
</figure>

This is not an example of strategically wise building. The buildables
are too close together, making them vulnerable to fire with a
[Grenade](Grenade "wikilink") or the [Flame
Thrower](Flame_Thrower "wikilink"). Visible are:

1.  Three [Trappers](Trapper "wikilink"). Trappers are weak, but highly
    useful to immobilize humans. The usefulness in matches against bots
    is currently low, because of a bug that allows bots to aim while
    trapped. This results in quick destruction of Trappers by bots.
2.  A [Barricade](Barricade "wikilink").
3.  Five [Acid Tubes](Acid_Tube "wikilink"). Usually, it would be better
    to put them on walls or ceilings, to prevent them from
    [Grenades](Grenade "wikilink").
4.  Two [Hives](Hive "wikilink") on the ground. As for Acid Tubes, it
    would be better to put them on walls or ceilings.
5.  A [Leech](Leech "wikilink"). The position near the door is not
    optimal, as it will be rather to easy to destroy. Destruction of a
    leech might result in the temporary disabling of some alien
    constructs.
