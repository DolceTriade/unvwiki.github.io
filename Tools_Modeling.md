## Free and libre model editors

- [Blender](Tools_Blender "wikilink"), .

See also [Tools/IQM](Tools_IQM "wikilink").

## Other non-libre model editors

Documentation for the following tools as is relevant to creating content
for Unvanquished may be written:

- 3ds Max;
- Maya;
- Photoshop;
- ZBrush.

These may have been used by members of the team for work on
Unvanquished. It is less likely that documentation will be written for
proprietary software packages due to typically steep licensing fees. We
recommend the usage of free open source tools anyway.
