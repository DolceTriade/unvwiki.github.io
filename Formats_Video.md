The terms <dfn>lossy</dfn> and <dfn>lossless</dfn> are used multiple
times in this page. Lossy means that video files compressed using that
format will lose some of their image fidelity to save space. Lossless
means that the compression will not sacrifice iimage fidelity, no matter
how much you compress the video file with that format.

## Tools

See [Tools/Video](Tools_Video "wikilink").

## Licensing

The following licenses are suitable for video files:

## videoMap formats

### Supported

- — a lossless compressed format from legacy id Tech engines.

### Removed

- OGM — a lossy compressed format muxing Theora video with Vorbis audio
  in an OGM container (OGG derivative).

The Theora codec was broken and considered unsafe and then
[removed](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Daemon/pull/391). OGM itself
was questionable as the OGG container would have been expected instead.

## Recording formats

- — a container used with MJPEG lossy compressed format.
