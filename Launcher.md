## Benefits of the launcher

The most obvious benefit of using the launcher is that you immediately
find out when there is a new release, and can acquire it with one click.
Some additional nice things:

- Installing a release that you already have functions as a "repair"
  operation. If any files are missing or corrupted, the launcher detects
  this and redownloads them.
- Transfers less data: when downloading a new release, any packages
  reused from a previous release that you already have do not need to be
  downloaded again, unlike if you had used the [universal
  zip](universal_zip "wikilink").
- (Linux and Windows) Installs `unv://` protocol handler which works
  with the [web server list](https://unvanquished.net/servers).
- (Linux and \[TODO\]Windows) Instructs the OS that the good GPU should
  be used, for those laptops that have dual Intel and Nvidia GPUs.
- (Mac) The downloaded executable won't have pesky "quarantine"
  attributes interfering with running it.
- (Windows) TODO: install firewall rules allowing LAN games to be played
