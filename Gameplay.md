evolve every release. This page documents a gameplay guide both for new
players and players of previous games (eg GPP Tremulous).

# Gameplay Guide

## Building system

Each team is given a set amount of structures and build points at the
start of the match. These BP are used up to build more structures, and
cannot be recovered once structures have been destroyed. Aliens must
build [leeches](Leech "wikilink") and humans must build
[drills](Drill "wikilink") to obtain more during the game.

Returns from [drills](Drill "wikilink") and [leeches](Leech "wikilink")
decrease over time. It is very important to build some at the beginning
of each match.

The more distant [drills](Drill "wikilink") and
[leeches](Leech "wikilink") are from each other, the more efficient they
are in extracting build points. If built too close together, they may
conflict with each others and even destroy build points! So, place them
with efficiency strategy in mind.

## General tips

- Always have at least 2 spawnsn
- When moving base (ending with reactor and overmind), ensure you have
  spawns and defenses in the new base,
- You can prevent a building to explode by deconstructing it,
- Do not stay near “dead” buildings, they will explode and hurt you,
  except for aliens near alien buildings.

Also read [humans](Humans#Tips "wikilink") and
[aliens](Aliens#Tips "wikilink") specific tips.

## Humans

The lists for equipment, buildings are in the
[Humans](Humans "wikilink") page.

### Humans tips

- Don't run around alone. Unlike aliens, humans have little of chance
  escaping when they encounter and overwhelming force.

<!-- -->

- Buy [armor](Humans#Armour "wikilink") before
  [weapons](Humans#Weapons "wikilink"). Most alien classes will kill
  unarmored humans in a single hit.

<!-- -->

- Do take part in rushes whenever they're called. Even if you die, it's
  likely that you'll accumulate some credits whenever team mates kill
  the thing you shot at. If nobody calls a rush, just follow someone
  around and shoot at what they shoot.

<!-- -->

- Don't use the [Lucifer cannon](Lucifer_Cannon "wikilink"), [flame
  thrower](Flame_Thrower "wikilink"), and [pulse
  rifle](Pulse_Rifle "wikilink") to defend your base, you'll only end up
  hurting it.

<!-- -->

- Look around a lot, learn the map, play as aliens to learn all the
  small details, or just spectate some aliens for a while to learn all
  the alien hiding spots.

<!-- -->

- [Radar](Radar "wikilink") is your friend, but you didn't need all
  wearing one.

### Building

- Build [turrets](Machinegun_Turret "wikilink") in such a way that they
  all support one another as much as possible. To this end, it is useful
  to build buildings that would block the turrets line of sight along
  walls, and especially in corners.

<!-- -->

- Build [rocket pod](Rocket_Pod "wikilink") for long range attack. They
  don't fire if they can hurt human or building, so, they can't protect
  themself or anything. It's for long range attack only.

<!-- -->

- Try not to cluster your base. If you must cluster, as you often will,
  it is better to have a few small clusters than to have everything in
  your base clustered slightly. [Marauders](Marauder "wikilink") will
  take full advantage of this. [Advanced
  Marauder](Marauder#Advanced_Marauder_.28electric.29 "wikilink") can
  also hurt structures that are immediately adjacent to each other.

<!-- -->

- Take an account of how many of each critical structure are needed.
  Usually you need two [telenodes](Telenode "wikilink"), but a third may
  be needed if your team is unusually large or feeding. You need one
  [armoury](Armory "wikilink"), but a second may be useful just in case
  the first is destroyed. Generally it is sufficient to have only one
  [medistation](Medistation "wikilink") powered by the reactor. Further
  [medistations](Medistation "wikilink") usually doesn't help as much as
  an extra turret. You also need the reactor itself, but that should be
  obvious by now. Each structure cost.

### Interface for fighters

</figure>

1.  The first weapons, always this weak [Blaster](Blaster "wikilink"),
    but can save your life in some situation
2.  The secondary (main?) weapon. On this picture it's the
    [Chaingun](Chaingun "wikilink")
3.  Your Armor, nothing for \[\[Basic_Armour\|Basic Armor\], L for the
    [Light_Armour](Light_Armour "wikilink"), M for [Medium
    Armor](Medium_Armour "wikilink"), BS for the [Battle
    Suit](Battlesuit "wikilink"). **Always buy armor first**.
4.  Your **medikit**, use this! Usualy by the "f" key stroke.
    - If you wear [grenade](Grenade "wikilink") and
      [radar](Radar "wikilink"), these also show here.
5.  Your stamina, to run and to jump.
6.  Your health. If it's under 50% you should use your **medikit**. May
    be you should come back to the base too.
7.  The [Momentum](Building_gameplay#Momentum "wikilink"). This is
    increased when you kill Aliens and destroy their
    [buildings](Aliens#Buildings "wikilink"). This allow you to access
    more equipment. If Aliens eat your [drills](Drill "wikilink") or
    your [buildings](Humans#Buildables "wikilink") or humans... you will
    loose momentum and they will gain momentum. Don't feed them!
    - The small red bar show when stages appends.
8.  How much credit do you have, to buy equipment.
9.  How many charger do you have. In this case there is none more
    available.
10. How ammunition still available.
11. The map, lag, FPS, times, where you are...

### Interface for builder

<figcaption>2021-11-HumanBuilder_interface.png</figcaption>
</figure>

Some information are visible on the fighter interface.

1.  The secondary weapon, the [Construction
    Kit](Construction_Kit "wikilink") here, not a weapon in fact.
2.  The radar, allow you to give your team the position of aliens
3.  For builder, the BP (Build Points) available. Can be slowly
    regenerated
4.  How many points to build available. If negative, you can add
    [drills](Drill "wikilink"), remove some
    [buildings](Humans#Buildables "wikilink"), destroy
    [Leeches](Leech "wikilink")...
5.  The builder can know exactly the health for each human construction
6.  When green, the construction can be deployed at this place.
7.  For [Machine gun](Machinegun_Turret "wikilink") and [Rocket
    Pod](Rocket_Pod "wikilink"), there is a "red" cone where they can't
    fire. Aliens can go under these and attack them

## Aliens

The lists for forms, buildings are in the [Aliens](Aliens "wikilink")
page.

### Aliens tips

- Always bite the head, even as a [dretch](Dretch "wikilink"). No need
  to jump to hit the head, just aim it. You can down an unarmored human
  in two bites to their head.

<!-- -->

- Get used to wallwalking as a dretch, even if it feel disorienting. It
  can make you impossible to hit.

<!-- -->

- Do remember to use your mobility to your advantage. With the sole
  exception of the [granger](Granger "wikilink"), you will be able to
  outrun humans at any speed. Don't run straight.

<!-- -->

- Don't simply walk on the ground if your form has other methods of
  movement. With everything from wall-walking to charging, aliens have a
  variety of ways to get across the map. These same movements also
  assist you with attacks, or may be attacks themselves.

<!-- -->

- Evolving back to a lower [form](Aliens#Forms "wikilink") will cost you
  some evolution point, the more you're injured the more you lose, so
  make sure to heal completely before devolving, and since it will cost
  you something in all case, think twice before picking a new
  [form](Aliens#Forms "wikilink"): the next step in the evolutionary
  line may not necessarily fit your current situation. Devolving is only
  possible when being close to the [overmind](Overmind "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- A more expensive alien is not always better. Each alien is suited to
  different situations.

<!-- -->

- Every alien [buildable](Aliens#Buildings "wikilink") can heal you but
  the fastest ones are the [overmind](Overmind "wikilink") and the
  [Booster](Booster "wikilink"). The [Booster](Booster "wikilink") also
  gives you some poison to increase the damage you give to humans. Don't
  forget to pick poison before looking for preys if there is a
  [Booster](Booster "wikilink") near to you!

### Building

- Move [buildings](Aliens#Buildings "wikilink") off the ground as early
  as possible. [Grenades](Grenade "wikilink") obliterate everything at
  human head height or below, but the damage done by [acid
  tubes](Acid_Tube "wikilink") is not noticeably affected when they are
  built high on doorways. Prefer [Hives](Hive "wikilink") when possible.

<!-- -->

- [Trappers](Trapper "wikilink") are ineffective on the floor. They must
  be able to shoot and bind humans with their slow projectiles — build
  them pointing at doors.

<!-- -->

- Forward [eggs](Egg "wikilink") and [boosters](Booster "wikilink") can
  be beneficial or simply feed the enemy.

<!-- -->

- Don't pile buildings, especially acid tubes, together. A single
  grenade will obliterate everything at once and will propagate the
  fire.

    [buildable](Aliens#Buildings "wikilink"), specially the
    [Booster](Booster "wikilink"))
3.  This claw is filed as your health
4.  The [Momentum](Building_gameplay#Momentum "wikilink"). This is
    increased when you kill Humans and destroy their

    more morph. If humans destroy your [leeches](Leech "wikilink") or
    your buildings or aliens... you will loose momentum and they will
    gain momentum. Don't feed them!
    - The small red bar show when stages appends.

7.  The map, lag, FPS, times, where you are...
8.  With the [Dretch](Dretch "wikilink"), and other
    [form](Aliens#Forms "wikilink") too, you should target the humans
    heads, this will increase damages a lot
9.  The small dot (or cross at impact) show you where you will bit.
    Don't forget to raise a few when you are a
    [Dretch](Dretch "wikilink").

2.  The claws, when you crouch to walk on wall (actually not activated).
3.  For Granger, the BP (Build Points) available. Can be slowly
    regenerated

    [buildings](Aliens#Buildings "wikilink"), destroy
    [Drills](Drill "wikilink")...
5.  When activated, the menu can show you what you can build, with the
    name, the price in BP and a description
6.  The Granger can know exactly the health for each Alien
    [buildings](Aliens#Buildings "wikilink")
7.  The shortcut number to select the item (4 in the pic)
