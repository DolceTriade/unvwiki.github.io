The heaviest human armor, and the only one that gives a lone human a
chance against a [Tyrant](Tyrant "wikilink").

Prevents the user from wearing backpacks ([jetpack](jetpack "wikilink")
or [radar](radar "wikilink")). Reduces Chaingun spread.

## Background

After the emergence of tyrants, the loss of 75 planets and 70% of the
army within a single month, have made the human command to seriously
think about developing a new type of armour. Sadly, although Google,
Microsoft and Apple have all shown an interest in taking on this
project, the higher-ups have instead given this job to the "open" source
community, just because it's cool and stuff.

**Apple:** There's not even a hint of hydraulics in your blueprints.
Come on, seriously? Do you want the solidiers to collapse in exhaustion
after like a minute of running?
**Developers:** It's for the betterment of the human species. The modern
civilization has all but eliminated the natural selection, and if
nothing is done, we won't be able to stand up under our own power
anymore!
**Microsoft:** We know that all these bumps on the back of the suit look
cool, but they'll make it impossible to use backpacks.
**Developers:** Yes. We know it and no we won't change it because it
just looks too cool!

**Apple:** Firstly, our whole army is made up of CLONES who CAN'T
reproduce, secondly, if we lose the war, everybody is going to die,
including you!
**Developers:** So what?

**Google:** We'll give you all the money we have! Please listen! We
don't want to die! \*Sob\*
**Developers:** Not interested.
