A <em>levelshot</em> is the image displayed fullscreen in the game while
a map is loading. Unvanquished game code expects the levelshot image
file at the (extension-independent) path `meta/$mapname$/$mapname$` in
the VFS. Conventionally, a levelshot is based on a screenshot of some
part of the map.
