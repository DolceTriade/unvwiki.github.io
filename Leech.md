Absorbs nutrients from the ground.

## Tips

- Spread them apart for maximum feeding efficiency. Keep in mind that
  two leeches right next to each other will get you less biomass than a
  single leech.

<!-- -->

- Defend your leeches well. If a leech is destroyed, you'll lose a part
  of your stored biomass.

<!-- -->

- If you feel a forward base with a leech in it isn't going to last any
  longer, deconstruct the leech to prevent the loss of biomass.

<!-- -->

- Leeches will be able to absorb less and less nutrients as the game
  progresses. Build them as early as possible.

Don't add Leeches too close, they annihilate themself. It's the same for
[Drills](Drill "wikilink") or Leech near a [Drills](Drill "wikilink").

Only the [Granger](Granger "wikilink") can see the amount of BP
provided, and, in this case that these Leeches consume BP instead of
providing.
