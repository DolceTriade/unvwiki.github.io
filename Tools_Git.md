## Installing Git

If you already have Git installed, you can skip this step.

### Windows

Windows users can acquire Git from the [MSysGit
project](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/). If you would prefer a
graphical front-end, there is
[TortoiseGit](http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/), but MSysGit must
be installed regardless.

### macOS

Apple has included Git with Xcode since version 4. You may download
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from Apple's developer
website. Please note that while XCode 4 was available for a very brief
time for 32-bit and Snow Leopard users for a small price (\$5 from the
Mac App Store), this is no longer the case; it is now free, but
available only to 64-bit Lion users. Snow Leopard (10.6) users and prior
may now only use XCode 3, which does not include Git. If you are one of
these users, you may [acquire a copy of
Git](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) from its site. A [selection of
GUIs for Git](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac) is also available.

### Linux

#### Debian and Ubuntu

Install Git using the package manager:

`$ sudo apt-get install git`
