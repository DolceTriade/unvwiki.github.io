Making maps for Unvanquished requires some tools. They are all free.

See [Getting started with
NetRadiant](Tutorials_Getting_started_with_NetRadiant "wikilink") for
installing it and getting started.

# Recommended tool load-out

You need:

- The **[Unvanquished game](https://unvanquished.net/download/)**
  itself, prefer installing the game with the [Unvanquished
  launcher](Unvanquished_launcher "wikilink"),
- The **[NetRadiant level editor](https://netradiant.gitlab.io)**, it's
  a level editor based on id Software's GtkRadiant and maintained by the
  community with a focus on game compatibility,
- The **Unvanquished editor gamepack** (provided with NetRadiant),
- The **Q3Map2 map compiler** (provided with NetRadiant).

When using another editor than NetRadiant (like GtkRadiant, see below),
you may still need a gamepack, and you would still need the Q3Map2 tool
tools from NetRadiant: if another Radiant provides Q3Map2 don't use it,
use the one from NetRadiant instead.

## Level editors

**Brush based** editors require you to make your maps using
[constructive solid
geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry)
(CSG). Most mapping tutorials for Quake-like games such as Unvanquished
follow this method.

**Polygon based** editors give a larger focus on 2D shapes making up 3D
ones, which *can* be more powerful but is more difficult to teach and
learn. These editors generally support *boolean operations*, allowing
them to be used like CSG editors, but with more difficulty.
