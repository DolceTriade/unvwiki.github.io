Fires damaging red shots at a considerable rate, with the disadvantage
of the shots being far slower than the conventional metal slugs. Up
close this is likely one of the best weapons in the game, and makes
quick work of alien bases.

## Tips

- Lead your shots, as the plasma blasts travel quite slowly. Unless they
  are walking straight towards you, shoot where you think they will be
  next.

<!-- -->

- Use this in vents and long corridors with low ceilings. With your rate
  of fire, it's likely that the alien will run off to avoid being easily
  shot up.

## Background

The latest in a new line of plasma-based energy weapons, pulse rifles
represent the pinnacle of human ingenuity in high-energy containment
fields. Each cartridge contains a miniaturized tokamak, stabilizing a
small quantity of searing plasma. When the trigger is held, some of the
plasma is ejected down the barrel of the gun, which is surrounded by
rapidly rotating magnetic fields. These fields create a sort of rifling
effect that stabilizes the projectile, leading to the weaponâ€™s name.
Upon leaving the barrel, the superheated plasma gives off a great deal
of light as it ionizes the air, imparting a glow as it travels along its
path. The plasma chars flesh to a crisp in a small area upon contact,
doing significantly more damage than conventional metal slugs can
accomplish. However, some of this energy is lost as it travels through
the air.

Having just left the experimental stage, the weapon is only beginning to
make its presence known in the arsenals of humanity, typically being
available to an assault team only after they have proven their worth
with more typical weaponry. It is one of the pricier weapons, although
in the right hands it can be very deadly.
