If you're porting data from Tremulous or Quake Ⅲ or you're an
experienced artist with Tremulous or Quake Ⅲ experience, you may want to
read the page.

You may also want to read the page for things that are not implemented
yet but you may find documentation about, or things that only work with
legacy Tremulous or Quake Ⅲ formats for now.

Some knowledge that should be sorted and properly written in dedicated
place can be found in the [Data dark magic](Data_dark_magic "wikilink")
page.
