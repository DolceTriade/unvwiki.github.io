navedit command can take 3 subcommands:

-

-

-

They all take the name of a navmesh, and there is navmesh per class.

When enabled, you will see:

- "surfaces" in blue color: they show the whole possible navmesh of the
  map?
- "surfaces" in yellow color: they show the part of navmesh examined by
  bots currently of matching class?
- lines of the said surfaces, in white, joining on black dots. They
  don't add any information.
- a line between bots and their current "next-target" (but not their
  goal)
- a white arc-circle-like shape (sometimes maybe a true, complete circle
  if you are lucky). This is probably what allows to edit the navmesh.
