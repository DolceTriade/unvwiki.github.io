The first alien form, selectable for free at spawning. Dretch is the
slowest and weakest alien form in game, second only to the
[granger](granger "wikilink"), but compensates for this with its silent
steps, small size, and wall-walking ability, making it exceedingly
difficult to detect or hit. Keep in mind that they are silent only while
they are moving, not jumping.

## Tips

- You can bite the head from the ground without jumping or wall walking
  simply by looking up at their heads. An excellent cheat! A fine hack!

<!-- -->

- Hide and attack humans from behind. Humans with only [basic
  armour](Basic_Armour "wikilink") will most likely die before they are
  able to react.

<!-- -->

- Walk on walls to make yourself harder to hit or find yourself a good
  hiding spot. Although it may be disorienting at first, it will pay
  off.

<!-- -->

- Don't move in straight lines. Your slow speed and low health ensure
  that you'll never be able to charge at humans.

<!-- -->

- Use poison. As a dretch, poison is your best friend. A clever dretch
  can run into a crowd of humans, and tag multiple humans with poison,
  forcing them to either use their valuable medkits or sustain heavy
  damage. It is also an easy way to gather evos when your buddies kill
  the humans.

## Background

It is unknown just where the dretch originated, for few aspects of the
toxic arachnoid suggest an independent lifestyle. The few internal
organs it possesses are vastly shrunken in comparison to its enormous
poison glands, which fill up the bulk of its thoracic cavity. Of the
dretches left behind after alien retreats, all die within hours, making
it exceedingly difficult to examine a living one in detail.

With its ability to climb any surface, the dretch is able to cling to
anything, patiently awaiting a passing human to deliver a poisonous bite
to. Once a dretchâ€™s fangs pierce skin, a sudden reflex delivers a spray
of venom into the wound, immediately causing necrosis of the flesh, with
several bites being lethal. In addition, a dretch is capable of moving
at great speed with utter silence, surprising those unfortunate humans
without radar equipment.

In its capacity as a mass-produced scout and assassin, the dretch can be
fielded in enormous quantities, absorbing minuscule amounts of nutrients
from the creep. While completely powerless against human structures,
poorly equipped humans are no match for its stealth and lethality. Even
armor is no foolproof protection against a swarm of dretches, for the
dozens of oozing fangs eventually find some hole to sink themselves
into.
