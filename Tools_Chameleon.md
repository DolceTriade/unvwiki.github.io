Chameleon is a standalone GUI-based texture replacement editor written
in Python and PyQt.

The tool is under development by [Viech](User:Viech "wikilink").

## Sources

The Chameleon source repository is
[github.com/DaemonEngine/Chameleon](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Chameleon).

## Features

Chameleon's main task is replacing a number of textures inside a `.map`
file while applying scale factors and rotation to all affected surfaces.
It allows you to:

- Replace old-fashioned textures with high resolution ones without
  loosing the alignment
- Choose the target shader/texture from a cached database
- Create and export replacement rulesets for later use
