Generates a lot of power in its immediate vicinity while also delivering
a small amount of power across the whole map, allowing humans to
establish forward bases more safely. It is capable of attacking aliens
that are too close to it, but with its limited range it is nothing to
count on.

## Tips

- You can recharge your energy weapons at the reactor.
- It will deal some damages (20 per second) to aliens close enough,
  which can help covering sensible nearby structures, especially in
  early stages since aliens usually needs to go close to structures to
  hit them.
