Long-range defense structure that fires powerful, homing rockets at the
aliens.

## Tips

- Build some [Machinegun Turrets](Machinegun_Turret "wikilink") near
  these. Rocket Pods will hold their fire if firing would damage humans,
  other structures or the Rocket Pod itself. They are completely
  defenseless when aliens get close to them.

As you can see on this screen-capture, some human weapons don't fire.

1.  The Machine gun can't fire because there human in the fire line.
2.  This is a Rocket Pod. The fire is hold because there is human or
    building near the target.
3.  These Machines Gun fire because they don't care about collateral
    damages and there is nothing in line with the target.
