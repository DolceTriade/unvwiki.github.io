## Chat networks

Our main chat platform is **Libera.Chat** IRC but there are also Matrix
and Discord rooms that are bridged together. Every people from IRC,
Matrix or Discord can chat together, read what others write and respond
to each others.

The chat is tantamount to a multiplayer version of Notepad; where ideas
are exchanged fast and furiously, words are taken out of context, people
misinterpret them, and feelings get hurt. In most cases, we trust people
to be kind, helpful, responsible and mature individuals. For everyone
else, we have these rules. Remember that access to our channel(s) is a
privilege that we provide, not a right. We reserve the right to revoke
your privileges.

### IRC

We use IRC ([Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC))
channels and our to discuss work on the game and help people. Many of
the developers, artists and players remain permanently connected in IRC
whilst others drop in and out when they can.

If you're asking for help please remember that everyone lives in
different time-zones and can't always be at their computer. You need to
stay logged into the channel for generally a few hours until you get a
reply. If this does not suit you, our might be better.

Our IRC channels are:

- [\#unvanquished](irc://libera.chat/#unvanquished) ([web
  interface](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#unvanquished)): the
  general channel. Often used to get help.
- [\#unvanquished-dev](irc://libera.chat/#unvanquished-dev) ([web
  interface](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#unvanquished-dev)): the
  development channel. Open to everyone.
- [\#unvanquished-fr](irc://libera.chat/#unvanquished-fr) ([web
  interface](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#unvanquished-fr)): a
  French channel. Un canal en français.

If these channels are even down we have a backup on QuakeNet:

- [\#unvanquished@quakenet.org](irc://quakenet.org/#unvanquished) ([web
  interface](https://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=unvanquished))

See our [chat page](https://unvanquished.net/chat/) for details.

### Matrix

- [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/!WnuetRiQZJNBTKwMrF:matrix.org)

The Matrix room is bridged with IRC and Discord.

There also exist a [IRC Matrix
room](https://matrix.to/#/!rWJbPedjfZkWXTvPIc:gnugen.ch) for people who
may prefer to use Matrix as an IRC client. The integration with IRC will
be more polished but using this requires more configuration from the
user and the Matrix built-in bridge is less reliable than ours.

### Discord

- [Discord room](https://discord.gg/usuDT9Pyna)

The Discord room is bridged with IRC and Matrix.

## Channel rules

By joining the chat you agree to the Unvanquished channel rules:

### Global rules

- **Irony or mocking towards and from anyone is not allowed, insults are
  not allowed**. If this happens, both parties will be asked to avoid
  talking to and about each other for a given time, to both protect each
  others and prevent the feeding of the drama.
- **It is not allowed to threaten someone to death neither to encourage
  someone to suicide, neither to express hope someone will die in any
  way.** This is a bannable offense and action will be taken on sight,
  no question asked.
- **Do not post links to illegal material or pornography**. No
  exceptions. This is a bannable offense.
- '''Do not spam the channel. This means repeatedly posting meaningless
  material, or the same thing several times in a row.
- **Do not abuse bots. Bot spam is not entertaining to anyone that isn’t
  the direct participant**. If you have to spam bot commands, use them
  via `/msg` to keep them to yourself.
- **Do not flame each other. Keep it to private messages**. If it gets
  out of hand, both sides of the conflict will take a short break.

### Development channel rules

- Stay on-topic! Try to keep discussions going about coding or assets.
  Offering constructive feedback whenever possible is encouraging and
  speeds up production.
- NO personal attacks are allowed (flaming someone beyond what would
  potentially be considered "tongue-in-cheek" criticism). We have NO
  TOLERANCE for this and you WILL be banned!
- Contact a developer if there’s a problem in the channel.

These rules will be enforced after either a private or public warning to
the offender to give them a chance to stop, followed by a quiet (+q) in
the channel, which will be removed when we feel you are ready to
participate in the conversation again.

If you have an issue with another developer that cannot be resolved by a
channel operator, please contact Ishq, illwieckz, Viech or cu-kai
directly.

### Platform channel rules

Extra rules may apply that are specific to the chat platform you connect
to, like the [Libera.Chat channel
guidelines](https://libera.chat/guidelines/), the [Matrix code of
conduct](https://matrix.org/legal/code-of-conduct) or the [Discord terms
of service](https://discord.com/terms).
