The term "Repeater" is actually a misnomer, as in actuality this
structure is a miniaturized version of the Reactor. While it can not
deliver its power into every corner of the map, something which its
bigger sibling is capable of doing, it will still continue to operate
and provide the much needed electricity to the nearby structures even
when the main reactor is being moved or destroyed, occasionally giving
humans a chance to recover from near defeat.

## Tips

- Be mindful of where you build it. The repeater blows up with a
  devastating force when destroyed, gravely damaging or outright
  destroying the structures around it. Furthermore, a single exploding
  repeater delivers enough damage to destroy another completely
  undamaged repeater, creating a chain reaction that can decimate an
  entire forward base in seconds.
- You might want to build some repeaters when preparing to move your
  [reactor](reactor "wikilink"). They will allow your defenses to keep
  functioning while the new reactor is being built. You can deconstruct
  them afterwards.
- You can recharge your energy weapons at it.
