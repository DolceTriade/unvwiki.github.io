Hey everyone. So, I'd like to get started on actually finalizing the
setting for Unvanquished. I need to do that if I'd like to write out a
formal background story! If you've missed it in a recent blog post, I
wrote out a timeline for the game universe. I'm open to suggestions,
comments, and criticism. Here is everything I have so far, and if I get
any good advice in this thread, I'll edit this:

### Unvanquished Timeline

- Human civilization achieves some sort of planet-wide unification. It
  isn't entirely peaceful, there's some resentment about the loss of
  national identity, but over the successive generations, some of the
  grumbling fades away. A few rebellions happen at some points during
  the process, and the way that they're handled might give hints to some
  sort of authoritarianism being involved. I'd like to leave that part
  open to interpretation. The unified human government can be viewed as
  benevolent, but with sinister dictatorial undertones.

<!-- -->

- Scientific progress continues at an accelerated pace, aided in some
  regards by the era of enforced planetary peace. New technology allows
  for a variety of things, including rudimentary nano-fabrication,
  nuclear fusion, mass-produced clones, and artificial intelligence.
  Clones are ultimately favored over humanoid machines, as they're
  easier to maintain, cheaper to produce, and do not run the risk of
  going rogue. Alternatively, the usage of robotic soldiers might have
  created widespread outrage and fear, similar to the usage of nuclear
  weapons. Thus, they have been forbidden from combat roles, as humans
  ultimately decide that only humans are permitted to kill other humans,
  not sentient machines.

<!-- -->

- Humanity begins to spread throughout the solar system, colonizing
  planets, moons, and the occasional dwarf planet. Technology for
  terraforming does not exist yet, so early colonists are required to
  live under domed settlements. They come with labor clones, who have
  been modified to be fully functional under harsh environmental
  conditions that would otherwise kill an unprotected human. A few
  machines are also brought along on expeditions, but as colonists do
  not have the means to produce more of them, they are outnumbered by
  labor clones.

<!-- -->

- Once humans have spread to all remotely habitable locations in the
  solar system, research into wormhole physics ultimately results in the
  creation of new spaceship engines that can travel entire lightyears in
  the span of a single day. Early experiments result in absolute
  disaster, as unfortunate test pilots repeatedly meet gruesome fates.
  Ultimately, the technology reaches a point where extremely powerful
  computers can calculate safe routes, and the first trips are made to
  nearby stars, where humans set up their first outposts beyond the
  solar system.

<!-- -->

- A network of wormhole routes are discovered through trial and error,
  allowing humanity to expand cautiously through the galaxy. Sentient
  alien life is not discovered, providing an eerie emptiness to
  humanity's expansion. Human colonies are entirely dependent on
  assistance and trade with Earth, providing the home planet with
  valuable minerals otherwise depleted by centuries of mining, while new
  colonists are sent to populate and expand the settlements. Some new
  worlds become powerful in their own right and send out colonial
  expeditions of their own, but are kept in check by the central
  authority on Earth. Terraforming is gradually introduced, and some
  promising planets are made hospitable, eliminating the need to wear
  protective suits and live under domes. Other planets are left barren.

<!-- -->

- Ultimately, aliens are encountered. The first contact is hostile, and
  they appear to be approaching from multiple directions. One colony is
  completely wiped out, and does not respond to communication
  broadcasts. Before an expedition is sent to investigate, several
  others send out distress signals. News quickly spreads through the
  human systems, which find themselves beginning to panic. A power
  struggle on Earth results in humanity's frontier being left
  unprotected, as opportunistic military factions attempt to wrest
  control from the civilian government, promising a proper response to
  the alien menace in a clear attempt at seizing total control. Travel
  to and from the solar system is prevented by a military blockade as
  Earth descends into chaos.

<!-- -->

- Abandoned and hopeless, the defenseless frontier is besieged by the
  onslaught of the alien menace. Pooling their meager resources
  together, the dominant frontier worlds begin to raise armies, an act
  forbidden in the past due to the iron grip of Earth. Some lucky
  colonists are evacuated to established systems, although millions die
  horrendous deaths in the initial weeks of the conflict. The aliens
  approach rapidly and in increasingly larger waves, with no sign of
  stopping. Resources stretched thin, the newly created frontier
  governments at last make a decision to send in the clones. Created in
  massive numbers, they are given their nano-fabricated environmental
  suits, a stockpile of cheaply produced weaponry, and shipped off to
  hot combat zones.

<!-- -->

- **Present day.** The clone armies achieve some degree of success, and
  manage to maintain a stalemate with the alien menace. Yet, in addition
  to sightings of increasingly powerful alien forms, there is utter
  silence from Earth. Rumors abound of a new imperial government, one
  that is currently in the process of reconstructing the human presence
  in the war-ravaged solar system. If the rumors are true, the frontier
  governments fear an ascendant Earth, one that would not take kindly to
  the military strength of its old colony worlds. Banding together for
  protection, the new Alliance of Frontier Worlds administrates the
  periphery of human space, a ring of colony systems surrounding the
  fringes of early human expansion. Facing threats of alien destruction
  and imperial reprisal, the clone armies fight onward into an uncertain
  future.
