The chaingun provides a high rate of fire, moderate damage per shot, and
a large ammo capacity. It fires many weak shots at a rapid pace, and
causes enough knockback to send your view flying all over the place if
you're not crouching or wearing a battlesuit. Absolutely fantastic
against tyrants and opponents that keep moving around.

## Tips

- Stay close to your opponent, as the chaingun is far too inaccurate for
  long range combat.
- crouching helps accuracy, but makes head more vulnerable
