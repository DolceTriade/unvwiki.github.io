Unvanquished development is proud to present you our game:
**Unvanquished**.

> Unvanquished is a free, open-source first-person strategy game
> shooter, pitting technologically advanced human soldiers against
> hordes of highly adaptable aliens. Players can choose from either
> team, providing for an entirely different experience on both sides, as
> humans focus on long-range firepower while aliens rely instead on
> quick movement and stealth. The goal of each match is to destroy the
> enemy base, preventing members of the opposing team from spawning.
> Upgrades for both teams are earned by a combination of individual
> performance and team map control, unlocking access to more powerful
> weapons and equipment for the humans, and larger, more ferocious forms
> for the aliens.
>
> Our project has been in development since the summer of 2011, with our
> very first alpha release being made on February 29th, 2012. Ever
> since, we have made monthly alpha releases, with each new release
> adding new content in the form of assets, maps, gameplay, or engine
> features. Our development team consists of a mix of skilled hobbyists
> and seasoned professionals from around the world, and we are always
> receptive to new team members, both from the community and beyond.
>
> Unvanquished is a fork of [Tremulous](https://tremulous.net), powered
> by the Dæmon engine. The that powers our game is ultimately based off
> [Quake 3](https://ioquake3.org), along with features from
> [ET:XreaL](https://www.moddb.com/mods/etxreal), as well as our own
> coding efforts.

## Game mechanics

### Real time strategy game

Unvanquished is a real time strategy game: build your base, strengthen
your defenses, create outposts. To win the game your team must deny the
opposite team the ability to return in game by destroying their
spawnpoints.

### Team-based first person shooter

As a player you play with a team. A game ends when either the human team
wins or the alien team wins. Your feats of arm contribute to your team
momentum and unlock abilities, weapons and buildables.

### Class-based online warfare

As an alien you spawn as a builder or as an attack form, and you evolve
to other classes as the game continues. As an human you chose the
construction kit and do the builder job to fight the resource war, or
prefer the rifle to fight and destroy. With your earned credits you buy
more advanced weaponry and armors.

## Game history

**Unvanquished** is a fork and a continuation of the
[Tremulous](https://tremulous.net) game, itself inspired by the Quake 2
mod [Gloom](http://www.planetgloom.com/). After having been a Quake 3
mod, Tremulous was released as standalone 1.1.0 version in 2006.
Tremulous attracted a lot of attention and gained a wide popularity,
benefiting from the open source release of Quake 3 code by idSoftware
and from the open source community interest. At the time, Linux users
have seen in games like Nexuiz (ancestor of
[Xonotic](https://xonotic.org)) and Tremulous the proof open source
games were possible. It was also a time where Linux gaming market was
very small and such games drained a lot of attention thanks to their
care of the Linux user base.

### The Tremulous 1.2 release that never came

Unfortunately, the highly-expected 1.2 version of Tremulous never came,
despite a “gameplay preview” having been distributed. In the mean time,
there was multiple projects working on the open sourced code of Quake 3,
including the engine, with projects like ioquake3 and XreaL. Despite
XreaL having never really been used by a game at the time except for a
small proof of concept shooter, the showcase of the various implemented
features caught the eyes of many peoples. People tried to build
alternate engines for Tremulous reusing some XreaL improvements, those
efforts gave birth to [TremFusion](https://tremfusion.net/) in 2008.

### The rise of XreaL and Tremfusion engines

The Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory code was then open sourced and XreaL
started to mix XreaL with it to produce ET:XreaL. A project to revive
Tremulous attracted some people and some information was delivered about
the project under the TremZ name, while the engine, forked of ET:XreaL
was then named OpenWolf. The TremZ name was not definitive, neither the
OpenWolf name. Another Tremulous mod that went nowhere kindly gave the
Unvanquished name and the domain name. The git repository and
organization was renamed from TremZ to Unvanquished, the engine renamed
to Dæmon, and the game was released as first alpha under the
Unvanquished name on February 29 of 2012.

### The birth of Unvanquished and Dæmon engine

From the beginning, Unvanquished was heavily linked to Tremulous, as
most early members of the Unvanquished project were already heavily
invested in Tremulous or renowned Tremulous projects.

Stijn “Ingar” Buys was a member of the official Tremulous team when
working on the Tremulous 1.2 project and joined the Unvanquished team as
level designer and among other things contributed the Vega map and the
Vega texture set, initially targeted for Tremulous, and then adapted and
improved for the Dæmon engine features. Ingar was also known to
distribute builds of the level editor and Tremulous game pack, he did it
for Unvanquished for multiple years as well.

Jan “Stannum” van der Weg was a member of the original Tremulous team
who already released standalone Tremulous 1.1.0 and earliest mods (his
*Transit* map is one of the oldest Tremulous map, known to already been
featured in tremulous-q3-1.0.0 froom 2005), Stannum joined the
Unvanquished team for 3D Modeling & Animation and provided multiple
models and textures for the game.

Amanieu d'Antras and Corentin “kangz” Wallez who were already known for
their work on their successful TremFusion engine before joined the team
for Engine Development.

Jack “EmperorJack” Purvis, Cody “Supertanker” Jackson, Paweł “Pevel”
Micek and Maximilian “Viech” Stahlberg were renowned mappers from
Tremulous community and were well known for their popular maps. They
joined the Unvanquished team for Level Design and ported or remade some
of their Tremulous maps for Unvanquished: Thunder (EmperorJack),
Spacetracks and Station15 (Supertanker), Perseus, Antares and Yocto
(Pevel), and Parpax (Viech).

Many others peoples who joined Unvanquished were already heavily
invested in Tremulous community projects or related projects like
ioquake3. You can read all their names and get more information about
Unvanquished people and contributions on the [Unvanquished About
page](https://unvanquished.net/about/).

Initial project head was composed of kharnov, Harsh “Ishq” Modi, and
Maximilian “Viech” Stahlberg. In 2017 kharnov had chosen Thomas
“illwieckz” Debesse to replace him at the project head as he had to
focus on other topics in its life.

### Free and open source again

Based on the free open source Tremulous game, the Unvanquished game was
never intended to not be free, but with time some assets were merged
with problematic licenses like Creative Commons licenses with
non-commercial clauses and some models just lacked the appropriate
license mention from the author. After multiple years of reaching pasts
contributors, the game became libre again in 2020 (see our [Now we are
free!](https://unvanquished.net/now-we-are-free/) blog post).

On a related topic, Unvanquished wiki was using a license that was
considered non-free because of a non-commercial clause, in fact nobody
was able to explain why this clause was there, it may have been a
mistake. After years of reaching contributors to get permissions to
relicense and rewriting other pages, the wiki was liberated on 2021, see
the [Wiki relicensing](Wiki_relicensing "wikilink") page and the
[Unvanquished 0.52.1 blog
post](https://unvanquished.net/unvanquished-0-52-1-better-freer-stronger/).
