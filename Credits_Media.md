## Licensing

## Unvanquished media licenses

This site should list license and author (according to the desired form
of attribution) of **every** data file that is shipped with the game
inside the <filename>`_`<version>`.dpk` files. Please make sure you keep
this site up to date when you contribute assets. Maps, even those that
are shipped with the game, have to maintain and ship their own
comprehensive license files, preferably as a text file in an `about/`
directory inside the DPK.

If you are part of the development team, feel free to release your work
in the name of “Unvanquished Development”. You can add a note that
explains that you are the author.

For each directory, add one entry for any number of files that has the
same author. You can use `*` as a wildcard character for file names.
Separate multiple files with space. When multiple patterns match, the
one that is highest in the list wins.

Here are some tables summarizing asset licenses of files shipped with
the game. Those tables are work in progress and may not contain all
information we may have yet, and some packages may ship files from
various sources. This is good enough to get a big picture.

### Textures

Notes:

- exm texture was relicensed to since evillair relicensed ex and Viech
  agreed to relicense his modifications too;
- cr4zy's tech zip contains a CC BY-NC-ND wording but he explicitely
  relicensed to CC BY SA 3.0 lately and it's now stated on his website;
- a texture provider made a special exception to allow EmperorJack to
  relicense ej01 to CC BY SA 3.0 at the condition we remove any
  reference to them;
- CC BY SA 3.0 asset modification allows mixup with CC BY SA 4.0,

### Maps

### Models

There are three generations of models:

- Generation 3, actual generation, high quality. Textures are high
  resolution and ships normal and specular maps. First person weapon
  models have hands with skeleton-based animations.
- Generation 2, legacy models, produced at the beginning of the project,
  medium quality. Texture resolution is high enough but lack normal and
  specular maps. First-person weapon models have hands with vertex-based
  animations.
- Generation 1, tremulous models, copied straight from Tremulous, low
  quality. Low texture resolution without normal and specular maps.
  First-person weapon models do not have hands.

## Upcoming models

Those models may be added in game in the future:

## Removed models

Those models were removed or replaced, there may be reusable for other
features or by mods:
