Trail effects work the same as Tremulous. Please see the [Tremulous
documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200416190204/http://tremulous.net/manual/#x1-140003.3)
([pdf](https://dl.unvanquished.net/docs/20060317-000.tremulous-manual.pdf))
for information on creating particle effects for now.

Trail format is game-specific (mods may modify it).
