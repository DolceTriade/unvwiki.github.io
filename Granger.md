The granger is the alien teamâ€™s builder class.

## Tips

- Think before your build. A well thought out base will last much longer
  than a hastily built one.

<!-- -->

- Move your structures to walls and ceiling when Advanced Granger
  becomes available to protect them from [grenade](grenade "wikilink")
  and [pain saw](Pain_Saw "wikilink") users.

<!-- -->

- Leave some space between your structures if possible. Tightly packed
  groups of them burn up easily if ignited.

<!-- -->

- If your structures are on fire, spit on them to extinguish the fire.

<!-- -->

- Avoid fighting at all costs; if your base comes under siege you should
  hide and rebuild during a break to avoid
  [feeding](Glossary#feeding "wikilink").
