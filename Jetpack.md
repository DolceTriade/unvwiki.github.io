The jetpack enables the human team to access higher ledges and similar
outcrops which are inaccessible by foot. The jetpack has a fuel gauge
that will deplete when powered on and will recover fuel when on the
ground. When hurt, you will loose some fuel.

## Tip

- Fly to cross open areas quickly. It's difficult for aliens to catch a
  flying human.
- [Acid tubes](Acid_Tube "wikilink") and [Spikers](Spiker "wikilink")
  will damage humans passing by, which will hinder their flying.
