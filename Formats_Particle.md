Particle effects work differently than in Quake 3 but the same as
Tremulous. Please see the [Tremulous
documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20200416190204/http://tremulous.net/manual/#x1-130003.2)
([pdf](https://dl.unvanquished.net/docs/20060317-000.tremulous-manual.pdf))
for information on creating particle effects for now.

Particle format is game-specific (mods may modify it).

There is a [particle effects
editor](https://www.quake3world.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=37893) for
Quake 3 that will likely need much modification to work with the
Tremulous-style particle effects system. Source code is available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/FS-NulL/New-Quake-3-Particle-Studio). A very
brief tutorial on its usage by Frozen Sand (creators of Urban Terror) is
[also
available](https://www.moddb.com/games/world-of-padman/downloads/frozen-sand-particle-studio-v10).

An older particle effects editor (not updated in many years) was also
available. Dead link:
