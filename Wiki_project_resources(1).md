# Resources

## Useful Pages

Note: keep these as subheadings on the front page to make navigation
quicker

- [Wiki editing guidelines](Wiki_Editing_Guidelines "wikilink")
  - General rules
  - Links to extra help for editing wikis

<!-- -->

- [:Category:OutOfDate](:Category:OutOfDate "wikilink")
  - Lists pages marked with the
    [template](Template:OutOfDate "wikilink")
  - Please help reduce this list by fixing pages!

## Wiki templates you may want to use

These templates have to do with the wiki's content, not the game itself.
They are here to make the job of being a human, whether an editor or
just a reader, easier.

To use these: type or copy the whole into the text of a page while
editing it.

### Whole Page Marking

Put these at the top of pages to mark them.

- [Brain dump](Template:BrainDump "wikilink") — for marking pages that
  contains quickly written information to be sure to not forget but
  needing to be redacted in a better way and maybe moved to more
  appropriate pages.
  - or

<!-- -->

- [Out of Date](Template:OutOfDate "wikilink") — for marking pages that
  need help
  -

<!-- -->

- [Pet Project](Template:PetProject "wikilink") — for mega pages
  actively being developed
  -

<!-- -->

- [Deprecated](Template:Deprecated "wikilink") — for pages that have
  been merged or superseded, and will eventually get binned
  -

  - Ordinary emailconfirmed users can't delete pages. Use this to show
    you have made the effort & the admins will follow through by looking
    at [:Category:Deprecated](:Category:Deprecated "wikilink")

  - Please only mark pages with this *when you are finished!*

  - This is for merging multiple pages into one, not moving a *single*
    page. You can do that already once emailconfirmed.

<!-- -->

- [Unknown](Template:Unknown "wikilink") — for pages that make no sense,
  seem temporary or possibly unrelated to the game
  -

  - Pages marked with this will eventually get deleted

### Inline Page Usage

Use these wherever and however you want.

- [Note](Template:Note "wikilink") — big NOTE boxes superimposed on page
  -

<!-- -->

- [Verify](Template:Verify "wikilink") — request other wiki editors to
  confirm whether something is true or not
  -

<!-- -->

- [Rehost](Template:Rehost "wikilink") — request for an external page to
  be copied onto the wiki
  -

  - Read the licensing documentation on the
    [rehost](Template:Rehost "wikilink") page before attempting to copy
    marked links

# Staying logged in

The wiki's login session times out quickly. Simply open up the main
site's login page (link in the upper right corner of this wiki) to
inherit the 'logged-in' status from the main site (which lasts much
longer): you don't actually have to fill in the login information again.

# Contacting the Admins

If you are having issues on this wiki or want to contact an admin for
any other reason *to do with the wiki*, start with
[User:Veyrdite](User:Veyrdite "wikilink"). For all other issues and
questions: please use the [chat](chat "wikilink") and .
