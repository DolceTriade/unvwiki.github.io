The Lucifer cannon, known affectionately as the Luci, is the most
powerful weapon in the human arsenal. It is capable of killing any alien
or alien structure in a single shot, except for the
[Tyrant](Tyrant "wikilink") and the [Overmind](Overmind "wikilink"). Be
aware that if charged for too long, the plasma blast will leave the
barrel spontaneously and explode right in front of it, damaging the
user. Fortunately, the weapon gives off a loud warning signal just
before that's about to happen.

## Tips

- Lead your shots, as the plasma blasts travel quite slowly. Unless they
  are walking straight towards you, shoot where you think they will be
  next.

<!-- -->

- Think before you shoot. The last thing you want to do is to kill a
  team mate instead of the enemy.

<!-- -->

- Don't use it to defend your base, especially against fast aliens. The
  missed shots and the splash damage will severely damage your own
  structures.

<!-- -->

- Use it against alien bases. It can destroy any alien structure in one
  shot except for the [Overmind](Overmind "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- Use it to keep dretches and other lower level aliens at a manageable
  distance.

## Background

Developed by satanic scientists, the Lucifer Cannon was once known as
Lucifer's hand. Nobody could resist her power, thus causing a quarrel
among the scientists. As soon as they vanished and nobody could perfect
her, an arms dealer laid their hands on her blueprint. Step by step they
tried to recreate the power of hers, in order to dominate the world.
Nobody was able to manufacture a weapon as beautiful and deadly, so they
began selling her to the military. Now being issued to the soldiers that
have earned her power, she is capable of destroying bases within a
matter of seconds. Nobody dares to stand in her path, but many choose to
abuse her power and either overcharge or use her abilities too often,
usually causing death of enemy and friend alike.
