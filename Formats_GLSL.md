The OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) is a language to write graphical
compute operations. It is used by the at multiple step of the rendering
task.

GLSL is well documented outside of this wiki, so you may want to read
other pages like:

- <https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language>
- <https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)>

The provides some specific features like a feature to reuse multiple
GLSL snippets in other GLSL files, macros, or working methods to do
specific things like supporting both OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL 3.1+ in a
single file, we may document that in the future.
