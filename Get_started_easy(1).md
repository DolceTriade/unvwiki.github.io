The almost quicker way to play the game, and way to don't be frustrated.

## Setting things up

- Use the [Unvanquished launcher](https://unvanquished.net/download/) to
  install and run the game:
  **[Linux](https://unvanquished.net/download/linux)**,
  **[Windows](https://unvanquished.net/download/windows)**,
  **[macOS](https://unvanquished.net/download/macos)**.
- Personalize your name, please. You can add
  [colors](Colours "wikilink") too.
- Read and select a preset, choose a screen resolution, and test. The
  scenes with fire, flames, and aliens buildings need the most power
  rendering.
- Read and select a key binding preset, customize if needed. Write or
  memorize keys for : moving, crouch/claws, primary attack, secondary
  attack, jump, the **medkit** (very important!), action menu, grenade.

1.  Where you can personalize your name;
2.  For graphics settings. The presets are easy to use, but these
    presets won't change the resolution screen, to change the resolution
    go to the Video tab from the graphics settings window;
3.  Choose a layout, change binding eventually, and write or memorize
    the important keys for **Move** and **Abilities**, especially for
    the **medkit**!
4.  You are ready to choose and join a server.

## Playing it

### Game presentation

The objectives in this game are rather simple: there are 2 factions, but
there's is only enough space for 1. So you need to destroy the other
one. To do that, you will need to build and defend base, so that you and
your friends can destroy enemy's base. Each faction have unique
abilities, and to build buildings, you need to either spawn as a
builder, or to equip (construction kit, CKit) or evolve as one (granger,
advanced granged).

The 2 factions are:

- aliens, which rely on mobility (walking and jumping on walls and long
  jumps "pounce" notably), melee attacks and biological radar that
  allows them to sense their enemies from afar;
- humans, which are nimble and can leverage the power of technology to
  shoot their enemies from a safe distance;

To destroy the enemy's base, it is likely you will need to improve your
equipment or abilities. To do that, you will need credits or evolution
points that you get by destroying enemies and their ugly constructs, and
to merit the trust of your faction, by building momentum that will widen
your possibilities.

You can find more details on the different factions this wiki:
[humans](humans "wikilink") and [aliens](aliens "wikilink").

### Solo training

Before joining a server for more serious games, you might want to train
yourself against artificial players (bots). For that, you can "Start a
local/LAN game". Currently, you can not add bots or configure said game
before entering it, but you will be able to do changes and add bots by
the main menu, when in-game. For server configuration, including the
skill of bots which will be added, you need to click on "Server Setup"
under "Options". You might have to scroll a bit to reach it, though.
Adding bots can be done either by clicking on the "Add an alien bot" or
"Add a human bot" lines, or by "Server Setup", by adjusting the "minimum
team size" slider.

### Advice

- Invest time to read some [Gameplay](Gameplay "wikilink") for the
  interface. **Humans are easier to play for start**.
- Don't feed enemies (**do not die** and **do not build undefended
  structures**). Because Unvanquished is not same as other FPS. Each
  kill/death or destroying buildings will change the "*momentum*" and
  this determine what human's equipment are available, or Alien's forms.
  Humans should stay in group.
- Beginners shouldn't builds, but can repairs if there is no bots.
  Because each building consumes build points (BP), they are precious. A
  building at wrong place can change the game issue.
- Don't worry, beginners dies often. Try your best. Use your **medkit**.
- Don't forget to use your **medkit**, this can save you, and stop
  poisoning. Reload your **medkit** at the
  [Medistation](Medistation "wikilink").

Enjoy! It's a game.
