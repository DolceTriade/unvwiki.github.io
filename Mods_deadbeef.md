[category:Mods](category:Mods "wikilink") Deadbeef is a mod by freem,
which have various aims, notably:

- slower paced mod
- improved GUI/HUD
- AIs experimentations
- campaign and PvE scenarios
- theme-based rotations depending on month/week
- and probably other stuff I can't think about yet...

Of course, many of those changes might land into to the official game,
and the mod itself is still very young for a very huge goal. It will
take time to be complete.

I intend to make updates on the change history here, as it will be more
convenient than maintaining an in-game changelog. It will have a
dedicated forum entry to notify of updates in a more accessible fashion,
but experience proved me than those are also very hard to maintain.
