## Motto

Here are some motto to help make and keep Unvanquished a welcoming
place:

<span style="color: #fffacd;">**You can do it**</span>

*Don't be intimidated for trying to contribute something, every
contributor is not less than a man.*

<span style="color: #fffacd;">**Be bold as a merger**</span>

*It's better to improve iteratively something that is not perfect than
to not merge anything.*

<span style="color: #fffacd;">**Be patient as a reviewer**</span>

*If you think there is something better to be done, you will have time
to do it yourself later.*

<span style="color: #fffacd;">**Everything submitted is a gift**</span>

*People come to submit changes to make us a gift, not to be obligated to
do something.*

<span style="color: #fffacd;">**Don't put excessive weight on someone
else's shoulder**</span>

*Never expect from a man an expectation only a god can fulfill, every
contributor is not more than a man.*

## I want to bring a change to ______. What do I need to know?

Anyone can contribute changes! There are separate pages for guidelines
for the following:

-

-

Once your change is ready, it has to be submitted for review then
merged, see also:

-

-

We recommend to submit changes using Git and doing pull requests. If you
cannot, see the page.

## I'm skilled at ______. How do I become a developer?

### For content creators

Please let us know that you are interested in producing content for the
game via [chat](chat "wikilink") or the and someone will get in touch
with you with further instructions.

### For programmers

Talk to the team! Just introduce yourself on [chat](chat "wikilink") or
the and get involved in discussion. If you appear to be intelligent and
posses the right attitude, you may be made into a contributor without
even having contributed any actual code.

## How does the project work?

Unvanquished is developed by individuals around the world over the
Internet. Individuals involved with the project can be divided into a
few different categories:

- **Project Leaders**, Currently, there are only three of these, they
  are responsible for:
  - Art lead ‚Äî Responsible for maintaining quality of all elements of
    the visual and auditory aspects of the game that are not controlled
    by code.
  - Programming lead ‚Äî Responsible for overseeing development of the
    engine and game code.
  - Meta-project & Public Relations lead ‚Äî Responsible for public
    relations (any interactions with our player base and the outside
    world) as well as recruiting new developers.

  Input from project leads is considered only in some cases to be law,
  but that doesn't mean that discussion from other individuals will not
  change what the project leaders do or say. The aim of project leads is
  to guide, not rule: if a project lead has an unpopular opinion, it
  will not be enforced in any way. The development **team** as a whole
  is responsible for shaping Unvanquished, not a handful of individuals.
  Developers are not *expected* to do what they are asked, but if a
  project lead makes a request, then there is generally a reason for it.
- **Developers**, These are all those who actively make large
  contributions (in terms of effort) to the project.
- **Contributors**, These are those who have made smaller or more
  infrequent contributions to the project, or who do not wish to get too
  involved.
- **Users**, Those who play the game but do not contribute any further
  than to merely provide discussion fall into this category.

## How often is there a release?

The game is currently in Beta.

In the past releases were made once a month but because of most members
of the team being busy in their lives, releases are now made at a slower
pace (mostly when people are available to sustain a release).

## Where does discussion take place?

Unlike many open-source projects, we do not have a mailing list.
Instead, discussion occurs in one of two places:

- The , where long-form discussion takes place, and
- The [chat](chat "wikilink"), where short-form discussion takes place.

Because of the verbose nature of the forums, they are the preferred
destination for any serious discussion. Moreover, the forums allow
individuals **from all timezones** the opportunity to contribute to
discussion, and discussion generally stays much more on-topic.

Do note that there are two separate forums for discussion:

- "Development", and
- "Community Development".

**Development** is for the development of official features of the game
to be shipped in a future release. It's focused on Media contributions
as most of the code discussion happens in GitHub issues.

**Community Development** is for any development around the game (like
mods, new tools, etc.) without any need to be released as a core part of
the game and then not requiring the same constraints. Some experiments
may be done as community development first then be integrated with the
game or as official product.

The **Development** forum also has a sub-forum named **Project
Planning** that currently requires **Contributor** or **Developer**
status to be seen.

There are also two other forums that are purposed for artists: **Level
Design** and **Map Releases**, the first one is for discussions about
level design techniques, architecture or inspiration, level design
tools, showing off your in progress work, etc. while the second one is
dedicated to release threads for your maps, being official or not.
