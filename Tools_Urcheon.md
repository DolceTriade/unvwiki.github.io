Urcheon is a tool to manage, build and package Unvanquished assets, and
I designed the asset repository layout.

The tool is under development by [illwieckz](User:illwieckz "wikilink").

## Sources

The Urcheon source repository is
[github.com/DaemonEngine/Urcheon](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Urcheon).

## Features

Urcheon can:

- prepare an asset repository:
  generate materials using [Sloth](Tools_Sloth "wikilink") and other
  files to be used by the [NetRadiant](Tools_NetRadiant "wikilink")
  level editor and the [Q3map2](Tools_Q3map2 "wikilink") map compiler;
- build an asset repository:
  convert images, sounds, compile maps, etc. and produce a `.dpkdir`
  directory usable in game;
- package an asset repository:
  package converted image sounds, compiled maps, etc. and produce a
  `.dpk` archive usable in game and distributable.

## Dependencies

Urcheon depends on many tools, see the
[DaemonMediaAuthoringKit](DaemonMediaAuthoringKit "wikilink") page for
details and an easy way to install all of them.
