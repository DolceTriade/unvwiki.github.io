Detailed build animations ala StarCraft II would be a lovely feature.

## Styles of animation

### Human buildables

- In outside areas (ones with a visible line of sight to the skybox),
  human buildables could fly down from the heavens, as if jettisoned
  from a ship high above, out of sight.
- Show buildables teleporting into place.
- Show buildables appear in a semi-finished state then assemble
  themselves.

### Alien buildables

- Have thick creep that covers the ground ala Starcraft. Dynamically
  create a bump on the surface (implying that something is moving
  underneath) that travels from the Overmind to the target location,
  which bursts through and somehow morphs into the desired buildable.
