Allows aliens to evolve and alien buildings to function.

## Tips

- Don't allow any space behind the Overmind.
- Overmind can deal low amount (10 per second) of damages to humans
  close enough, but it's unlikely to kill any non-bot player.
- Place a [Booster](Booster "wikilink") near the OM will help the OM to
  regenerate, but [Bossters](Booster "wikilink") are weak and can be
  easily destroyed.
