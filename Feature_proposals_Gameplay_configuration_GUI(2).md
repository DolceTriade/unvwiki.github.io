A config tree could be added, where each node is one of

- Tree (has more subnodes)
- Boolean
- Integer
- Float
- String

This would allow to access and adjust every configurable number in the
following way:

`game.buildings.reactor.health = ...`
`game.classes.dretch.weight = ...`
`network.port = ...`
`client.width = ...`

Everyone who has seen <about:config> in Firefox knows how such options
can be edited.
