Demos are recorded segments of gameplay that may be replayed at a later
time. The engine also supports rendering demos directly to a video file.

Demo commands:

- Begin recording with `/demo_record` (optionally followed by a name for
  the demo).
- Stop recording with `/demo_record_stop`, or by disconnecting.
- Get a list of demo filenames with `/dir demos`.
- Play back a demo with `/demo `<var>`demo_name`</var>.
- Convert the currently playing demo to video form with `/demo_video`.
- Stop recording to video with `/demo_video_stop`.
- Configure *all* games to be recorded as demos with `/cl_autorecord 1`
  .

## Video editing

Once you've recorded a demo to video, you'll probably want to do some
amount of editing to make it interesting.

There is a comprehensive table comparing different video editing
software on
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_editing_software).
