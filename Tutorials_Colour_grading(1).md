Colour grading allows you to change the colour and brightness tints of
an entire map.

**Disclaimer:** This feature is controversial. Some players turn it off
to improve the visual clarity of the game.

# Requirements

![`Neutral.png`](Neutral.png "Neutral.png")

- A screenshot of your map, preferably of the area you want to work with
- The neutral colour grade
  - found in main/cgrading/ of your .pk3s
  - Optionally right click and save the skinny image on the right of
    this page.
- An image editing program. This guide uses the GIMP, but you can use
  anything.

# Guide

Here is the screenshot used in this tutorial. It's of the alien spawning
view on Parpax, and it has a nice variety of colors to work with:
![<File:Colourgrade>
original.jpeg](Colourgrade_original.jpeg "File:Colourgrade original.jpeg")

Load the screenshot in your image editor and adjust the image's colour
curves.

- GIMP: Colors menu -\> Curves
- Other editors: may be under the name of "levels"

Modify the curves of your colour channels until your screenshot obtains
the desired look. Each "channel" affects a colour of the image. In the
GIMP "Value" is a channel holding brightness.

In this example the picture has been made slightly brighter, redder,
bluer and less green. Viech (the author of [Parpax](Maps "wikilink"))
will probably cry to see such a garish colour scheme, so don't tell him
this is here.

<figure>
<img src="Colourgrade_2.png" title="File:Colourgrade 2.png" />
<figcaption><a href="File:Colourgrade">File:Colourgrade</a>
2.png</figcaption>
</figure>

Now save your curves. In the gimp, you click the *plus* button next to
the presets drop-down menu.

Apply these same modifications to the neutral colour grade image:

<figure>
<img src="Colourgrade_3.png" title="File:Colourgrade 3.png" />
<figcaption><a href="File:Colourgrade">File:Colourgrade</a>
3.png</figcaption>
</figure>

Save the modified colour grade in your map's folder hierarchy. Eg:

`ultimate_frisbee.pk3dir/gfx/test_colour_grading.png`

- Make sure it is inside a *gfx* subfolder.
- You can save it in any format the engine understands. Jpeg is **not**
  recommended.

## Testing in-game

Load your map in Unvanquished and use the *testcgrade* [console
command](Console "wikilink") to load your colour map. Eg

`/testcgradeÂ gfx/test_colour_grading.png`

![<File:Colourgrade>
4.jpeg](Colourgrade_4.jpeg "File:Colourgrade 4.jpeg")
![<File:Colourgrade>
5.jpeg](Colourgrade_5.jpeg "File:Colourgrade 5.jpeg")

## Applying to your map

Place your colour grade in a subfolder with your map's name. Eg:

`ultimate_frisbee.pk3dir/gfx/`**`ultimate_frisbee`**`/test_colour_grading.png`

In NetRadiant: add a key/value pair to the "worldspawn" entity by
selecting any non-entity brush and pressing the **N** key.

- key: "gradingTexture"
  - note capitalisation
- value: "gfx/ultimate_frisbee/test_colour_grading"
  - WITHOUT the file extension

For example, on chasm-b1, the key/value pair is: **colorGrade :
gfx/chasm/colorgrading**
