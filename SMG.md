The standard-issue human weapon.

## Tips

- Get to learn the weapon very well. If you do, you'll get credits
  faster to use the more powerful weapons. It's also likely the only gun
  you'll have if your team is without an [Armory](Armory "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- Don't use this against anything better than a regular
  [Dragoon](Dragoon "wikilink") without support, and even then, be
  careful. Unless you have magic aim, the majority of your shots
  probably won't hit. A single rifle is especially powerless against a
  [Tyrant](Tyrant "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- Use this weapon in teams. A coordinated group of humans equipped with
  only rifles can take down even the strongest of alien opponents.

## Background

Having undergone relatively few design changes over the last century,
the SMG is exceedingly cheap to manufacture, and is thus the weapon
entrusted to the newest of recruits. With few moving parts and
simplistic circuitry, they are easy to maintain and are unlikely to jam
when needed most, making them reliable and a favorite of those that come
to depend on its stability during combat. Just as historic rifles
propelled a round down a rifled barrel, these weapons operate off the
same principle, although with a rapid, magnetically-assisted feed system
that allows for an incredible rate of fire while the trigger is held.

By far the most common weapon in the human military, it is highly
effective against the smaller forms of aliens, with the ability to
dispatch most of them in a few seconds of well-aimed fire. As the weapon
is configured to fire in bursts over a short distance, it is
considerably less useful at ranges, where the highly accurate energy
weapons are more appropriate.
