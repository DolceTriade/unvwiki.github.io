Heals the human standing on it. Issues a medkit when the healing is
complete.

## Tips

- A medistation can only serve one human at a time. Build more if this
  becomes a problem.

<!-- -->

- If you haven't used your medkit, use it before stepping on a
  medistation. This way you will get your health back much more quickly.
