Navcons are text files storing connections between two parts of a
navigation meshes. It's useful to connect two disconnect navigation
meshes, for example to allow bots to jumps from a platform. There are
two kinds of connections, unidirectional and bidirectional ones. In the
past the files were using a binary format but since Unvanquished 0.54
those files are using a text format, which is better for storing them in
map repositories.

## How to create navcons

The navcon files are generated using the tool in game.
