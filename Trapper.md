Trapper shoots blobs of adhesive that glue humans to the floor.

## Tips

- Don't build them on the floor. They can only fire in a narrow cone. No
  human (at least we hope so) is stupid enough to jump over a trapper.

<!-- -->

- Try to hide them, considering their meager 50 health.

<!-- -->

- Use them together with [Hives](Hive "wikilink"). Hive insects are
  deadly but too slow to catch a human... well, not anymore!
