Spiker unleashes a shower of spikes at the humans trying to sneak past
it.

## Tips

- Don't build them too close to other buildings. Spikers can only fire
  all their spikes at once and will not do that if firing would deal
  more damage to aliens and neighboring buildings than to the enemy.

<!-- -->

- Build them in such a way that the spine of the spiker is directed
  towards passing humans.

<!-- -->

- Build them in vents or tight hallways.
