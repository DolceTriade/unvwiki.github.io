As you can see on this screen-capture, some human weapons don't fire.

1.  The Machine gun can't fire because there human in the fire line.
2.  This is a Rocket Pod. The fire is hold because there is human or
    building near the target.
3.  These Machines Gun fire because they don't care about collateral
    damages and there is nothing in line with the target.

These Machine Gun and buildings are a little too close, but they provide
a strong defense. When they explode after damages, they will also damage
other buildings too. But still a good example.
